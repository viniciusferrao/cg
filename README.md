This is an assignment for Computer Graphics course.

It consists of a 2D drawing board capable of displaying some polygons and rays to the infinity. There’s a mode to show intersections within polygons and rays using some colors: green color is used when it’s the first interception on a given polygon and red when it’s the second one. Editing mode is also supported.

The instructions are pretty basic, since the software is almost self-explanatory. To run it just clone the repository and open index.html on your browser.

Live version of this code is available [here](http://www.if.ufrj.br/~ferrao/cg/raycast).
